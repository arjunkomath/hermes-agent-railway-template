# Hermes Agent Railway Template

One-click deploy [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent) on [Railway](https://railway.app) with a web-based config UI and status dashboard.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/hermes-agent)

## What you get

- **Web Config UI** — configure LLM providers, messaging channels, tool API keys, and model settings from your browser
- **Status Dashboard** — monitor gateway state, uptime, provider/channel status, and live logs
- **Gateway Management** — start, stop, and restart the Hermes gateway from the UI
- **Basic Auth** — password-protected admin panel
- **Persistent Storage** — config and data survive container restarts via Railway volume

## Quick Start

### Deploy to Railway

1. Click the "Deploy on Railway" button above
2. Set the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable (or a random one will be generated and printed to logs)
3. Attach a volume mounted at `/data`
4. Open your app URL — you'll be prompted for credentials (default username: `admin`)
5. Configure at least one LLM provider API key and your messaging channels, then hit Save
6. Once setup is complete, remove the public endpoint from your Railway service — the web UI is only needed for initial configuration and Hermes operates entirely through its configured channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.)

### Run Locally with Docker

```bash
docker build -t hermes-agent .
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme -v hermes-data:/data hermes-agent
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and log in with `admin` / `changeme`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Web server port |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Basic auth username |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(generated)* | Basic auth password. If unset, a random password is generated and printed to stdout |
| `GATEWAY_AUTO_START` | *(auto)* | Set to `true` to always supervise the gateway or `false` to keep it stopped. By default it starts when a messaging channel is configured. |

All Hermes configuration (LLM providers, messaging channels, tool API keys) is managed through the web UI.

## Architecture

```
Railway Container
├── Python Web Server (Starlette + uvicorn)
│   ├── / — Config editor + status dashboard
│   ├── /health — Health check (no auth)
│   └── /api/* — Config, status, logs, gateway control
└── hermes gateway — managed as async subprocess
```

The web server runs on `$PORT` and supervises the native `hermes gateway run` foreground process. Unexpected exits are restarted with bounded exponential backoff, while Hermes's planned restart exit (`75`) is respawned immediately. Gateway stdout/stderr is captured into a ring buffer and viewable in the dashboard.

## API Endpoints
